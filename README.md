# Experience with Firebase Messaging
  # Positives
    - Real-time Updates: Combined with Firestore and Realtime Database, Firebase Messaging ensures instant updates to users subscribed to channels.
    - Scalability: Firebase handles high volumes of notifications and messages without requiring complex server-side infrastructure.
  # Challenges
